# SignUpNow

This project is originally planned to be the system managing student registrations for activities in the Hangzhou Dianzi University, which is abandoned due to insufficient development time and later replaced by the outsourced 第二課堂 project.

It's a fork (with previous commits squashed) of the main frontend project of HDUHelp which I spent a lot more time on, so you may see many things removed here or there. It's also abandoned before achieving any meaningful functionality, so expect to be disappointed if you're interested.

Private information has been replaced with `[REDACTED]`, which in many cases breaks the code from running, so if you decided to use, please search for `[REDACTED]` and replace with correct values accordingly. In addition to private information strings, files below are removed due to copyright:

- `/res/WeatherIcons.sketch`
- `/public/favicon.ico`
- `public/img/**/*`

You may need to polyfill those files for this project to work.

This code is now released in [MIT](https://laosb.mit-license.org).
